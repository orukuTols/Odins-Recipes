<p><strong>What is Cheese-burger made of?</strong> <br>
    A cheeseburger is a hamburger topped with cheese. Traditionally, the slice of cheese is placed on top of the meat patty. The cheese is usually added to the cooking hamburger patty shortly before serving, which allows the cheese to melt.
 Cheeseburgers can include variations in structure, ingredients and composition.

    <li>Start with the Right Beef: <br>
 The best burgers are made from freshly ground, high-grade beef chuck in an 80/20 mix (meat to fat). Spread the beef out flat and season with salt and pepper.
  If you have a secret ingredient like Worcestershire sauce or chopped bacon, add it now. Toss together gently. You don't want to overmix.</li>
   <li>Making the Patties: <br>
Grab 5 to 6 ounces of meat and lightly toss from hand to hand, forming a ball.</li>
   <li>Pat It Into a Disk: <br>
    The patty should be at least as wide as your bun and about 3/4 to 1 inch thick.</li>
    <li>Perfect-Burger Secret Tip<br>
Make a divot in the middle of the burger with your thumb to help it keep its shape while cooking. These patties can be made ahead and chilled in the fridge.
</li>
   <li>Time to Flip <br>
    It's time to flip when the burger releases from the grate without sticking.</li>
    <li>Toppings <br>
To add cheese, move the burgers to the cooler side of the grill, top with cheese and cover the grill for a minute to let the cheese melt.
 Place the patties on buns, add other toppings and serve.</li>
